V8HorizontalPickerView
======================

How to use V8HorizontalPickerView
---------------------------------
Add the `V8HorizontalPickerView` header and implementation files (.h and .m)
along with the protocol header file to your app source and include them in
your project. (I like to keep them in their own group to keep things tidy.)

Implement the necessary delegate and data source protocol methods.
Instantiate and add the picker view to your view and wire up the delegate
and data source. That's it!

I modeled this after a lot of the standard Apple controls such as `UITableView`.

Delegate Protocol
----------------
    - (NSInteger)numberOfElementsInHorizontalPickerView:(V8HorizontalPickerView *)picker;

Data Source Protocol
-------------------
    - (void)horizontalPickerView:(V8HorizontalPickerView *)picker didSelectElementAtIndex:(NSInteger)index;
    - (NSString *)horizontalPickerView:(V8HorizontalPickerView *)picker titleForElementAtIndex:(NSInteger)index;
    - (UIView *)  horizontalPickerView:(V8HorizontalPickerView *)picker  viewForElementAtIndex:(NSInteger)index;
    - (NSInteger) horizontalPickerView:(V8HorizontalPickerView *)picker widthForElementAtIndex:(NSInteger)index;

The protocol requires the width method to be implemented and for either the
title or view *ForElementAtIndex: method to be implemented. (ie: you don't
need both)

Using Views for Elements
------------------------
If you are going to implement the

    -horizontalPickerView:viewForElementAtIndex:

data source method, make sure your view conforms to the 
`V8HorizontalPickerElementState` protocol.
